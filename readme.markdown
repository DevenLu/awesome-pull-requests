fix caching of styles, by @seanmonstar

> Fantastic pull-request! ðŸŒŸ -- @jbnicolai

The best use-case of [`Object.prototype.__proto__`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto). This is usually considered bad. However, due to the algorithm it's used in such particular use-case, this implementation is faster than other solutions. Check out the [excellent explanation](https://github.com/chalk/chalk/issues/32#issuecomment-48426969)!

https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/10732

Make modules Browserify compatible, by @bclinkinbeard

This PR was not merged but this leads to great discussion how to better support both newer and older module systems. In the early days angular and it's submodules were not common.js compatible. Angular, instead, had it's own module system with dependency injection. @bendrucker took the initiative and manually update all modules to be `require`able. Also [see this blog post](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/114584444410/using-angulars-new-improved-browserify-support).
